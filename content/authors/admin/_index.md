I'm a costa rican industrial engineering student at the University of Costa Rica. I also participate as Research Engineer, with GIS and Remote Sensing projects, in Asteria Space and Satellites Development, Edingburgh, UK. And I'm a current member of the Aerospace Engineering Group (GIA) of the University of Costa Rica.

My interests include space industry, science and engineering, programming lenguages and industrialization. My favorite hobbies are related with playing instruments (such as guitar and piano), reading books and practice sports (soccer and volleyball).
